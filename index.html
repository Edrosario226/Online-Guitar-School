				<h2>online guitar lessons: learn guitar and unlock your potential</h2>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Online Guitar School offers a method of learning guitar through video based, online lessons which aim to inspire and educate at the most economical price. Since its 2016 inception, Online Guitar School has served over 50,000 aspiring guitar players with high quality video lessons.  Always keeping the students needs in mind, lessons are produced with multiple angles giving the student maximum exposure to the instructor, as he teaches you how to play guitar. Beginner lessons start with easy step by step goals that give the student confidence and reduces the amount of frustration that can come with learning how to play guitar.  While most online guitar lessons throw the student into overwhelming chord fingerings from the get go, this program begins with simple single note techniques and build progressively, giving you the solid foundation you will need to advance and achieve your guitar playing goals.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Advanced lessons focus on skill, genre specific, and song study material. Once you have completed the beginner program or join as an intermediate player, you can focus on developing specific skills or styles that you enjoy. Study rock, blues, jazz, classical, flamenco, bluegrass, country, fingerstyle and more.  Develop skills such as improvisation, lead playing, and music theory. Learn from the over 150 song lessons provided, complete with accurate tabs. Dive into one of the artist study volumes and learn the style of guitar heroes such as BB King and Jimmy Page.</p>
